## About the Project
This is part of a broader self-initiated valuation series covering multiple Indian sectors. Built entirely in Microsoft Excel, it demonstrates how theoretical finance concepts like DCF, FCFF, FCFE, DDM, RIM and NAV- can be translated into practical, decision-ready models. 

## Objective of the project
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the practical application of financial analysis and valuation techniques across multiple sectors using Excel-based models, Specifically, this project aims to:

- Build sector-wise financial models using valuation models such as FCFF, FCFE, DDM, RIM, and NAV
- Forecast Income Statement and Balance Sheets for FY2026-FY2030 with structured assumptions.
- Assess Intrinsic value of companies across Banking, Energy, Defence, IT, Automotive, FMCG and Retail sectors.
- Apply ratio analysis and Dupont analysis for evaluating Financial performance
- Develop a professional portfolio that showcases skills in Equity research, valuation.

This initiative bridges classroom finance concepts with real-world financial analysis and offers a recruiter-facing demonstration of technical and analytical capabilities.
